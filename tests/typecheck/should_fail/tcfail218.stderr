    Overlapping instances for C [a] b arising from a use of ‛foo’
    Matching instances:
      instance [incoherent] C [a] b -- Defined at tcfail218.hs:5:10
      instance C [Int] b -- Defined at Tcfail218_Help.hs:7:10
    (The choice depends on the instantiation of ‛a, b’
     To pick the first instance above, use IncoherentInstances
     when compiling the other instance declarations)
    In the expression: foo
    In an equation for ‛x’: x = foo
