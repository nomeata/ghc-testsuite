      arising from a use of ‛asChild’
    Matching instances:

        -- Defined at T4485.hs:42:10
    (The choice depends on the instantiation of ‛m0’
     To pick the first instance above, use IncoherentInstances
     when compiling the other instance declarations)
    In the expression: asChild
    In the expression: asChild $ (genElement "foo")
    In an equation for ‛asChild’:
        asChild b = asChild $ (genElement "foo")

T4485.hs:47:26:
    No instance for (XMLGen m0) arising from a use of ‛genElement’
    The type variable ‛m0’ is ambiguous
    Note: there is a potential instance available:
      instance [overlap ok] XMLGen (IdentityT m)
        -- Defined at T4485.hs:36:10
    In the second argument of ‛($)’, namely ‛(genElement "foo")’
    In the expression: asChild $ (genElement "foo")
    In an equation for ‛asChild’:
        asChild b = asChild $ (genElement "foo")
